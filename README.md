Hey everyone! this is the demo application from the JSVidCon Javascript Conference! ðŸŽ‰

The application will show how to make Angular applications communicate with GraphQL servers using a mocked GraphQL server and a simple angular application.

Clone it, npm install it, run start and server scripts and you`re off to go! ðŸ¤˜

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Please use chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security for running chrome without the security it needs for talking to the mocked server.

## Mocked GraphQL Server

Run `npm run server` for running our mocked GraphQL server for the application use, when running it, you`ll be able to go to http://localhost:3000/graphql and query using GraphiQL without the application being running!
